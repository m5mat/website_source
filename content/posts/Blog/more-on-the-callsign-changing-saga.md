I was going to post the following to the [UK VHF Contesting group], until I thought better of it and decided not to poke the hornet's nest...

A bit of a warning to those who intend to upgrade or otherwise change callsign, and care about your UKAC results... You need to do it at the end of a year.

I upgraded to a full license a the RSGB Convention last year. Due to errors at Ofcom I've been issued a few different callsigns over the last few months (full details [here][M5MAT Blog Post], in case you're interested). I entered the January 2m UKAC using my then-valid callsign M0IZZ. That's no longer my callsign - it's now M5MAT - but what I didn't anticipate is that UKAC results are tied to a callsign, not to an individual so even though M0IZZ was me, I can't have credit for my Jan 2m entry in the overall 2m and overall UKAC results. Interestingly if M0IZZ is re-issued within the year, which it can be - my G2KS callsign has been re-issued, whoever gets it will inherit my Jan 2m credit.

I accept that how this situation arose in my case is slightly odd, however it's entirely possible that someone upgrading from Foundation to Intermediate or Intermediate to Full (or indeed going through the whole set over the course of a year) could be disadvantaged if they choose to surrender their old licence, as we're encouraged to do.
