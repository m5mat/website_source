I'm now MØIZZ!


After a fair amount of wrangling with Ofcom, including being issued G2KS for a period of 49 minutes, they have finally ignored my request for M5MAT and issued me MØIZZ. This callsign breaks a few of my self-imposed rules, notable it has a repeating character (Z) and also the twitter username @M0IZZ is not available, so on twitter I'll be [@M0IZZ_Matt][twitter].
