Notable QSOs
-----

 +  *G3MXH* (2019-08-06) - Terry, G3MXH helped me pass my novice exam 20-odd years ago and did much to help my enthusiasm for amateur radio.

 +  *I7CSB* (2019-07-02) - A 2m SSB contact using just 10W to an 8-element yagi over 1736km. Nothing un-remarkable about that! Sporadic E might have had a part in this.

 +  *9M4SJJJ* (2019-10-19) - The first contact of JOTA 2019 from GB1WSG was with 9M4SJJJ in Malasia. We used DMR for this and some of our youngsters got to talk to youngsters there.

 +  *G0ABI* (2019-06-09) - When I was a newly-licensed novice, the idea of satellites interested me, but they seemed difficult to get my head round, I also wasn't too sure whether or not novices were allowed to use satellites at the time. Well Intermediates definitly can, and I did. Pete will probably be the one and only person to contact 2E1HNK via satellite as I'll be using MØIZZ now. This QSO was FM via SO-50.

Summary
-----

Most of my operating this year was in the RSGB UKAC series of contests - much like last year.

Other notable events included running JOTA for 1st Woodmancote Scouts, which saw approximately 70 youngsters get their first&ast; introduction to Amateur Radio. The village also now has 70 more morse keys and buzzers in circulation than it did before, so apologies to the parents...

Last, and not least, I passed my full license exam and became MØIZZ.

&ast; It wasn't the first for all - some were already aware of amateur radio, and two have been pointed in the direction of the local club to hopefully get a foundation license.
