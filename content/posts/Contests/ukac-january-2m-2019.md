Surprisingly I was let out to take part in the UKAC on New Year's Day! I had assumed that this event would
be less-well attended than normal due to it being on January 1st, however that didn't seem to deter many
with activity levels being about normal, albeit with fewer people out portable. I was active again as
2E1HNK/P from Sudeley Hill (IO91AW) using 10W from my FT-857d and the 8-Element Yagi at 4.5m as normal.
