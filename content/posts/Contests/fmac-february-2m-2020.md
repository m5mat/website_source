My first FMAC entry for a while - it was busy but I did suffer with intereference from an M7 who was only 100 yards down the road! I also didn't realise that the 10W section rules had changed, so I needn't have put the x200 colinear up and could have used the beam instead. Oh well, you live and learn...
