Participated in both the 2m FMAC and UKAC events with a family meal
in the middle.

FMAC was just a single contact with the ever-present
M0RKX/P. I was hoping to get M0RSD too as Iâ€™d heard him a few
minutes earlier doing a demo for some foundation students but he
either had other commitments or Alcester-Dudley was a no-go.
Operated from the car park of the Moat House, Alcester (IO92BF, 21m
asl) using a Baofeng UV5R and the 2m/70cm mini magnetic whip that I
picked up in the Maplin closing-down sale a few weeks ago. I
started operating for the UKAC at about 9pm (2000 UTC), having
missed the first hour of the contest due to family commitments. I
made 11 contacts across 4 grid squares with the best DX being
G0HEL/P in IO81WG at about 107km - not too bad off a vertical.
Operating location was chosen primarily for its proximity to my
route home from the restaurant and was a lay-by off the B4088 just
south of the junction with the A422 (IO92AF, 122m asl). It was
surprisingly comfortable with the lay-by being set back from the
road and separated from it by some trees. This reduced the sound of
passing vehicles (not that there were many) and reduced the chance
of muggles taking an interest. This was the first outing for both
my Yaesu FT857d and Diamond X200. There was a small issue with the
FT857d ([see TechNote#1][TechNote1]) but
that was resolved on-site. The setup performed well, but has left
me wanting a 2m Yagi! The next problem that I encountered was when
I tried to submit the log the following day - I submitted it fine
but got an email enquiring about my RSGB membership status - I
hadn't realised that membership was a prerequisite for entering.
