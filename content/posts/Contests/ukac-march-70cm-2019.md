2m was a bust due to me being hit by a virus (human, not computer) about 20 minutes in to the FMAC section. I was down on Burson Moor in Cornwall (IO70sw) and taking down the station whilst in a 'afflicted' state was no fun at all. The less said about that the better. 70cm was much better, although RF conditions were challenging and the WX was not great either - no rain but high winds and bitterly cold.


Having been in touch with Mark M0RKX during the week, I used his regular site in IO92ba as he's not able to get out for the 2m and 70cm event for the time being. I was interested in how this site compared to my regular site at Sudeley Hill in IO91aw. Access at Mark's site is better - the ground is firmer and there is a very stout gatepost to lash a mast too, additionally he has explicit permission from the farmer to be there. RF-wise - my initial impression was that Sudeley Hill was actually better, although I'm fairly certain that prevailing RF conditions played more of a part that the site itself. Mark's site certainly should be better (slightly more elevated and actually on the crest of a hill, rather than just off it).

The DX (GD8EXI on the Isle of Man) had to be fought for, with plenty of patience on both ends - I'm pretty certain we only managed it with the help of aircraft reflections.

Hopefully next month will bring better conditions all round!
