Active as 2E1HNK/P from Cutsdean Hill (IO91BX) again, using

hour of the FMAC section then the same setup for the UKAC section.

### Lessons Learnt

* I need a yagi.
* If 1, I need a rotator (I don't fancy sitting out in the rain that we had last night to turn the beam).
* I have a terrible callsign for contests.
* I need a voice keyer.
* Cutsdean Hill is a good location RF-wise, however there isn't much space for parking and antennas. I lashed the mast to a convenient fence post but that wouldn't have worked for a yagi as the trees would have got in the way. A guyed mast would be needed, however there isn't much space on the verge for guys.
