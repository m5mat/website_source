I was active as 2E1HNK/P from Cutsdean Hill (IO91BX) using
10W from my FT-857d and a Diamond X200 vertical for the last half
hour of the FMAC section then the same setup for the UKAC section.


### FMAC

Section: 10W

Total QSOs: 7

Total Points: 398

Normalised Points: 667

ODX: G3ZNU (IO91PQ - 87km)

Final Position: 7 (of 18)

### UKAC

Section: AL

Total QSOs: 29

Total Points: 4,920 (1,920 + 3,000 bonus)

Normalised Points: 427

ODX: M0DXR/P (JO01DH - 167km) - Also got G3CZP/P (IO90JO - 160km) on the Isle of Wight, which I class as overseas :)

Final Standing 44 (of 75). Interestingly I'm the highest placed entry in low power section to use a vertical antenna, which is positive.

### Lessons Learnt

* I need a yagi.
* If 1, I need a rotator (I don't fancy sitting out in the rain that we had last night to turn the beam).
* I have a terrible callsign for contests.
* I need a voice keyer.
* Cutsdean Hill is a good location RF-wise, however there isn't much space for parking and antennas. I lashed the mast to a convenient fence post but that wouldn't have worked for a yagi as the trees would have got in the way. A guyed mast would be needed, however there isn't much space on the verge for guys.
