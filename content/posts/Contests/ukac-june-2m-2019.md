Another good month on 2m, not quite as high-scoring as last month (also fewer QSOs and fewer bonus squares) but I did have some good sustained runs. 70cm was interesting, I kept a really good rate up for the first 30 minutes, with pile-ups at times, but then conditions suddenly turned dire with long stretches of no contacts. In fact I got bored of calling CQ at one point and so tried an AO-92 pass, to no avail - I didn't even hear the satellite!
