This was the first (update: and also the last) use of my new Full callsign M0IZZ. I got off to a slightly late start but once under way the rate was reasonable. The final squares tally was also reasonable - not as good as last month but not the worst it's been either.

Following the contest and the [callsign confusion](/m5mat.html) I contacted the RSGB Contest Committee to highlight to them that I would need to enter future contests under a new callsign. More on that [here](/more-on-the-callsign-changing-saga.html)
