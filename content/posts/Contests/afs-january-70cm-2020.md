A bit of a half-hearted entry. Because of the time of the contest my primary site was unavailable and I eventually ended up at my 4th-choice site. This was just a layby/field entrance without any ability to mount a mast, so the mast ended up being braced against the car - and at reduced height due to the wind. It was pretty slow-going at times and I ended up packing up half an hour before the end of the contest. AFS contests don't suit single-op portable entries!
