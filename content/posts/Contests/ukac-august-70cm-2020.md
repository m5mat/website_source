First time running the 23-element 70cm DK7ZB yagi at the full 10m mast height ()although the pics below only show it at about 6m) - and it was rock solid, which was reassuring. Lightning stopped play early (at about 9:30BST) but to be honest things weren't going too well anyway. There was some DX (2 x GD and one in JO03) but I seemed to work more off the back of the beam than the front. The rig was also showing occasional SWR errors too, so I think the antenna needs a look over.
