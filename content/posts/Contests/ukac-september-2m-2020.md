This session didn't start too well - my primary site was unavailable, I'd forgotten the laptop PSU (and didn't have any pens/pencils so couldn't even log on paper), the mast support on the roof of the car decided to cease to be a support and the FT857d screen is now so badly zebra-striped that it is unusable. My dad generously offered to run the PSU out to me, the CAT connection to the rig actually worked for once (so I could cope without the screen) and everything else was sorted out on site. All this meant I missed the FMAC session but was up and running for UKAC. The 2m UKAC sessions are now incredibly busy - I struggled to find a free spot to call CQ and more often than not I'd only be able to make a handful of QSOs before being bumped off by another station calling on top of me. S&P did work well though and I think this week was my highest number of squares worked, and also my highest-scoring UKAC.
