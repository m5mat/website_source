Active as 2E1HNK/P from a new location - Sudeley Hill (IO91AW), using
10W from the FT-857d to the Diamond X200 for the FMAC section and a
borrowed 8 element yagi for UKAC. Generally a good evening however it
seemed to be harder work than it should have been, given that I was
using a much better antenna than normal.

Sudeley Hill is a good location, possibly not quite as good as Cutsdean
Hill RF-wise but there is more space to set up antennas and to actually
get the car off the road. Got some interesting looks form passers-by and
one stopped to chat, who happened to be a G8 from Cheltenham who was out
on his bike!

I didn't get on the air with enough time to make an impact on FMAC (currently
in last place) but was reasonably busy for the whole of the UKAC.

The beam was mounted on 2 sections of mast, giving a height of 3m. The mast
was braced against the side of the car putting the antenna about 1.2m above
the car, which probably isn't high enough. Plan for next time is to use 3 or 4
sections of mast putting the antenna at 4.5m or 6m AGL, however the two sections
that I used this time refused to come apart again. As it happens I can just
about fit the two sections in the car fitted together, however that won't work
if more sections get stuck!
