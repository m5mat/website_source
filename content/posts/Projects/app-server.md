Deadbeef Cafe appserver setup. This is mostly for my own reference

Inbound connections permitted on 80, 443 and 8080. 8080 goes directly to Tomcat, 80 & 443 are terminated by an nginx reverse proxy. This proxy redirects 80 to 443 and terminates SSL with a LetsEncrypt Cert (for app.deadbeef.cafe, other subdomains not implemented). LetsEncrypt cert is managed by certbot.

Services
---

The following services are running on the app server:

 * Tomcat
 * Nginx (as reverse proxy for tomcat)
 * MySQL server (not accessible to anything other than localhost)
 * Mosquitto MQTT broker (app.deadbeef.cafe:1883)

Sites
---

* Avatar (https://app.deadbeef.cafe/avatar)
* [DXClusterBridge](app-server-dxclusterbridge.html) - Bridges DXCluster messages to an MQTT Broker which is accessible on app.deadbeef.cafe:1883. Messages are posted to the broker using the username ```admin```. You'll need a user account on the broker to get access to messages. Request access from Matt MÃ˜IZZ. At this time messages posted to the broker do not go out to the wider DXCluster servers.
* Weblog (in progress)
