Active as 2E1HNK/P from Broadway Tower again.


Got off to a late start as I tried to put up a 9m mast to take best advantage of the forecast tropo enhancement. The mast had other ideas and effected an uncontrolled descent. This bent one of the elements but not too severely, so it didn't take long to bend it back and put the mast up at the usual 6m. I missed the first 15 minutes of the contest but go off to a good start nontheless. After running for about 20 mins I was approached by a gentleman hiking, who turned out to have passed the RAE at university but was unlicensed. He was attempting to return home (to Devon!) and was a bit stuck. I sorted a taxi out for him which cost me 10 minutes or so. The rest of the contest proceeded at pace and resulted in my best ever UKAC score.
