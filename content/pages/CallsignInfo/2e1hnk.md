Title: 2E1HNK
dmr_ids: 2341514,2344327
valid_from: 2000-01-01


2E1HNK was the first callsign that I was issued in either 1999 or 2000 (I can't remember exactly!). At the time it was a UK Novice Class B license, which gave me access to amateur bands above 30MHz (with some exceptions) and up to 10W. Later on, in 2015 when I re-activated my license after having let it lapse, I was grandfathered on to an Intermediate license which allowed up to 50W on most bands, including HF (but excluding 60m and a few others). This callsign is still valid but hasn't really been used since about the end of 2019.
