Home Shack
-----

There isn't much of a home shack at the moment...

What I do have up and running is as follows:

* An RTL-SDR dongle connected to a Diamond X200 2m/70cm co-linear 'white stick' antenna. The dongle is connected to a somewhat vintage (Centos 6) server and typically functions as an APRS iGate using Direwolf on the server. The antenna is mounted a whole 4' about the ground so the range is limited at best. The setup can be fairly easily re-purposed to fulfil other VHF/UHF monitoring duties and has been used to record the pilot audio from a Red Arrows pass, for example.

* A G5RV - this is mounted in the roof space of the detached garage. It is yet to actually be connected to a transceiver. The idea is that the FT-857d from my mobile setup could easily be attached to this, but it hasn't happened yet.

* The Shack Computer is an old Dell Optiplex 755 running Windows 10 and a bunch of Amateur Radio programs. The master log is kept in DXKeeper however I have issues with the chronically non-standard interface on this, so it may change at some point. I keep all logs as ADIF files in a OneDrive folder, which is sort of the actual master record but they're not very useable there. Ideally I'd like to use a cloud-based logging solution such as 2M0SQL's Cloudlog, I just haven't get round to setting it up yet.

Car
-----

Most of my operating is mobile or car-portable. My car is a Mitsibushi L200 Pickup Truck which is being slowly kitted out as a mobile shack. The current state is as follows:

* My FT-857d lives in the car, it is either mounted on the mounting bracket which is attached to the rear bulkhead (behind the rear passanger seats), or pulled out to use more naturally for car-portable operation. There are 3 CAT5 cables, one pair of 25A power cables and one 3.5mm male - 3.5mm female cable running from the mounting location to the passenger footwell to allow control and audio routing to the front of the car. The power leads extend through the firewall and to the starter battery. The CAT5 leads are used for the mike and the front panel, with 1 spare, and the 3.5mm extension lead is used for speaker audio.

* There is also a Motorola GM350 programmed for 2m FM use in the car although that is not permanently connected. This may become an APRS setup at some point. It comes out of the car for JOTA (which is why it was bought in the first place!)

* The on-vehicle antenna situation is currently limited to a dual band mini-magmount whip. I also have a CB antenna on a magmount which can be pressed into service. Using an LDG YT-100 this will tune up on at least 10m and 20m (other bands untested).

* Antennas that I use for car-portable work (mainly UKAC at the moment) include an 8-element 2m Yagi, a 23-element 70cm DK7ZB Yagi and a 7-element 70cm DK7ZB Yagi. I have a 9m sectional mast with a Yaesu G-450C rotator attached which seems to live in the boot. The rotator controller is powered from a 1000W inverter under the passenger seat.

* I used to use a dedicated laptop for logging in the car (a super-portable IBM Thinkpad X31), however this proved to have unreliable USB ports (at least when it came to rig-control) and also it's a 32-bit laptop which is becoming increasingly difficult to support. I now use my normal day-to-day Sony Vaio laptop with a second dedicated OS installed just for radio work (build instructions [here](https://gist.github.com/m5mat/c051ecffe19874804ae3e301c2465824#file-laptop-build-sh)). I use my mobile phone as a personal hotspot to get access to clusters, ON4KST etc.

Future plans for the mobile setup include more permanent mounting of the front panel (it currently just sits in front of the gear sticks) and a better HF antenna setup. I may permanently install a Raspberry Pi-based DMR hotspot in the car, which could also connect to the FT-857d and be used either for networked rig control, or accessed over the network and used natively as a logging PC for UKACs. I'd also like to install a seconds battery to run the radio kit so that I don't kill the starter battery, but that's a bit more involved.

Portable

I also have a couple of DMR Handheld radios - sometimes these are in the car with me - and a couple of Baofeng UV-5Rs programmed for FM satellite use. I have completed a grand total of one satellite contact.
