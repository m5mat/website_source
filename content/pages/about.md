Bio
-----

I was first introduced to amateur radio sometime in the mid to late 1990s via JOTA, I subsequently became licensed as 2E1HNK in 1999 with what was then a UK Novice Class B License. Many thanks to John, G8HJS (SK, 2015) and Terry, G3MXH for helping me through the Novice exam. I let my license lapse in 2003 after having not used it for a while - mainly because I was a student and had no money for amateur radio trinkets :(.

Fast-forward to 2015 and I re-activated my license, now as an Intermediate License. At the RSGB Convention in October 2019 I passed my Full License exam and, after a bit of a mix-up, was issued the callsign M5MAT (the mix-up is chronicled [here](/m5mat.html)).

At the moment my operating is mostly limited to going out portable for the RSGB FMAC and UKAC VHF/UHF contests although the rig typically lives in the car so if I'm on my own I often monitor local repeaters. I've also been known to operate HF SSB while mobile and occasionally DMR.

QSL
-----

QSL via [LoTW][lotw] is preferred, [eQSL][eqsl] is acceptable. I try to upload logs to LoTW regularly but if you're eager for a QSL then please feel free to prompt me to upload, [Twitter][twitter] is probably best.
