&lt;p&gt;Firstly, you need to know your local Brandmeister master node id. The UK node is &lt;code&gt;2341&lt;/code&gt; (list &lt;a href="https://brandmeister.network/?page=masters"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). The ID that we need to use is the first three digits of this id, with &lt;code&gt;999&lt;/code&gt; added, so &lt;code&gt;234999&lt;/code&gt; for the UK (USA: &lt;code&gt;310999&lt;/code&gt;, France: &lt;code&gt;208999&lt;/code&gt; etc.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note 1:&lt;/strong&gt; there is still quite a lot of old info about this on the internet. ID &lt;code&gt;5057&lt;/code&gt; is no longer in use on Brandmeister. If you read an article that uses this ID then you're either reading an out-of-date article, or one about the Phoenix UK Network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note 2:&lt;/strong&gt; You'll need to put CPS into &lt;code&gt;Expert Mode&lt;/code&gt; to change some of these settings&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, for each channel on which you want to be able to use messaging/APRS, the following settings need to be correct:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/thead&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;GPS Revert&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Selected&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Private Call Confirmed&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Selected&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Data Call Confirmed&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Selected&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;CSBK Data&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;not selected&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the Brandmeister Self-care portal, the &lt;code&gt;Brand&lt;/code&gt; for each ID should be set to &lt;code&gt;Motorola&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;GPS setup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To enable GPS, select the &lt;code&gt;GPS&lt;/code&gt; tickbox in &lt;code&gt;General Settings&lt;/code&gt;. Reports suggest that changing the GNSS setting to include GLONASS also helps with fix-times - presumable this is a European thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;code&gt;General Settings -&amp;gt; Persistent LRRP Requests&lt;/code&gt;, set &lt;code&gt;Persistent LRRP Requests&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;Save&lt;/code&gt; - this makes APRS updates more reliable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Testing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the radio is sending position reports, then your callsign should show up on &lt;a href="http://aprs.fi"&gt;aprs.fi&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can try sending an SMS message to your radio by using &lt;a href="http://www.findu.com/cgi-bin/entermsg.cgi?"&gt;findu.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To send a message from your radio to APRS, send an SMS to the master id (&lt;code&gt;234999&lt;/code&gt; for the UK, it might be worth storing this as a contact). The format of the message must be the destination callsign (with SSID), followed by a space, followed by the test of the message, e.g. &lt;code&gt;M5MAT-10 Hello Matt!&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bit of a warning to those who intend to upgrade or otherwise change callsign, and care about your UKAC results... You need to do it at the end of a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I upgraded to a full license a the RSGB Convention last year. Due to errors at Ofcom I've been issued a few different callsigns over the last few months (full details &lt;a href="https://m5mat.github.io/m5mat.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, in case you're interested). I entered the January 2m UKAC using my then-valid callsign M0IZZ. That's no longer my callsign - it's now M5MAT - but what I didn't anticipate is that UKAC results are tied to a callsign, not to an individual so even though M0IZZ was me, I can't have credit for my Jan 2m entry in the overall 2m and overall UKAC results. Interestingly if M0IZZ is re-issued within the year, which it can be - my G2KS callsign has been re-issued, whoever gets it will inherit my Jan 2m credit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I accept that how this situation arose in my case is slightly odd, however it's entirely possible that someone upgrading from Foundation to Intermediate or Intermediate to Full (or indeed going through the whole set over the course of a year) could be disadvantaged if they choose to surrender their old licence, as we're encouraged to do.&lt;/p&gt;

After the result was confirmed I filled in a paper application so that I could request a specific callsign - M5MAT (the online system doesn't allow you to request a particular callsign).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as I could tell that callsign was available - it wasn't registered on QRZ.com, it didn't come up as being assigned in recent Ofcom FoIA responses and nothing showed up when searching for it on Google, Twitter etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After paying the £20 fee Ofcom were happy to confirm that I had been issued the callsign G2KS. Err, wot?!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's obviously not the callsign I requested, but it's also not from the M0 range which they should have issued if the callsign that I had requested was not available. This didn't make any sense, so I phoned them up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've always found the people on the phones at Ofcom to be really helpful and this time was no different. I explained what had happened and that I was confused about the callsign I had been issued. They dug out the paperwork and confirmed that I had requested G2KS and had therefore been issued it. I told them that this simply wasn't the case and I suspected that paperwork may have been inadvertently shuffled so could they please compare handwriting or something. Apparently whoever had applied for G2KS had sufficiently different handwriting to me to make it obvious that the paperwork had been mixed up somehow. They informed me that they'd need to go via their policy people to get it resolved. Lo and behold, a couple of days later G2KS was revoked and I was issued with M0IZZ. This was still not what I had requested but obviously M5MAT was not available for some reason so they had issued me with the next available M0 callsign. I was annoyed that I didn't get my choice but there you go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All sorted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or was it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Looks like in a recent FoI &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Ofcom?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@ofcom&lt;/a&gt; provided a list of valid ham radio callsigns as of Sept 2019 minus personal info &lt;a href="https://t.co/X5rqVW7af4"&gt;https://t.co/X5rqVW7af4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Peter Goodhall (2M0SQL) (@2m0sql) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/2m0sql/status/1213444497880866817?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 4, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A tweet from 2M0SQL alerted me to a more recent FoIA response from Ofcom which was published in September 2019. M5MAT didn't show as assigned in this list. The chance of that callsign being issued in the period between the list being published and me requesting it was pretty small, so I phoned up Ofcom and re-explained the situation. They confirmed that M5MAT was still available and that they would have to speak to their policy people - I guess their policy department must be one of the busier departments there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of days later I received a slightly concerning email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My full license had been revoked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No other explanation, nothing about another one being issued or anything like that. By the time I had the email and phoned them up their helpdesk was closed too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I logged in to the licensing portal and my old intermediate license was there but nothing about a full one. It dawned on me that when I was originally issued with my G2KS callsign I had to pay an invoice via the licensing portal. I didn't get an email or any other notification to tell me that I needed to pay, the invoice just silently appeared and sat there. I eventually found my way back to that part of the portal (it's not very obvious) and there was another invoice for me to pay. I had hoped that I wouldn't need to pay anything extra - I'd already payed the £20 fee once - but at least its not too much. Once I paid it I was issued M5MAT and there we go, 4 callsigns (including my intermediate one) in 4 months and the reason why I've popped up during UKAC contests in multiple different guises recently.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="license"></category><category term="M5MAT"></category></entry><entry><title>2m UKAC January 2020</title><link href="https://m5mat.github.io/2m-ukac-january-2020.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-01-07T23:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-01-07T23:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Matt, M0IZZ</name></author><id>tag:m5mat.github.io,2020-01-07:/2m-ukac-january-2020.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This was the first (update: and also the last) use of my new Full callsign M0IZZ.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;G3MXH&lt;/em&gt; (2019-08-06) - Terry, G3MXH helped me pass my novice exam 20-odd years ago and did much to help my enthusiasm for amateur radio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I7CSB&lt;/em&gt; (2019-07-02) - A 2m SSB contact using just 10W to an 8-element yagi over 1736km. Nothing un-remarkable about that! Sporadic E might have had a part in this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;9M4SJJJ&lt;/em&gt; (2019-10-19) - The first contact of JOTA 2019 from GB1WSG was with 9M4SJJJ in Malasia. We used DMR for this and some of our youngsters got to talk to youngsters there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;G0ABI&lt;/em&gt; (2019-06-09) - When I was a newly-licensed novice, the idea of satellites interested me, but they seemed difficult to get my head round, I also wasn't too sure whether or not novices were allowed to use satellites at the time. Well Intermediates definitly can, and I did. Pete will probably be the one and only person to contact 2E1HNK via satellite as I'll be using MØIZZ now. This QSO was FM via SO-50.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of my operating this year was in the RSGB UKAC series of contests - much like last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other notable events included running JOTA for 1st Woodmancote Scouts, which saw approximately 70 youngsters get their first&amp;ast; introduction to Amateur Radio. The village also now has 70 more morse keys and buzzers in circulation than it did before, so apologies to the parents...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last, and not least, I passed my full license exam and became MØIZZ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ast; It wasn't the first for all - some were already aware of amateur radio, and two have been pointed in the direction of the local club to hopefully get a foundation license.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Avatar</title><link href="https://m5mat.github.io/avatar.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-12-09T18:30:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-12-09T18:30:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Matt, M5MAT</name></author><id>tag:m5mat.github.io,2019-12-09:/avatar.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Avatar is a simple avatar generator.

&lt;p&gt;Got off to a late start as I tried to put up a 9m mast to take best advantage of the forecast tropo enhancement. The mast had other ideas and effected an uncontrolled descent. This bent one of the elements but not too severely, so it didn't take long to bend it back and put the mast up at the usual 6m. I missed the first 15 minutes of the contest but go off to a good start nontheless. After running for about 20 mins I was approached by a gentleman hiking, who turned out to have passed the RAE at university but was unlicensed. He was attempting to return home (to Devon!) and was a bit stuck. I sorted a taxi out for him which cost me 10 minutes or so. The rest of the contest proceeded at pace and resulted in my best ever UKAC score.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="UKAC"></category></entry><entry><title>MØIZZ</title><link href="https://m5mat.github.io/moizz.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-11-19T12:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-11-19T12:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Matt, MØIZZ</name></author><id>tag:m5mat.github.io,2019-11-19:/moizz.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm now MØIZZ!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the first appearance of my newly-finished 23-element yagi. Unfortunately conditions were not good so there wasn't much demonstrable improvement over the old 7-element one. An additional problem was that whilst it is quite easy to get the 7-element up to the full 6m mast height (and I think 9m might be quite straightforward too, if I don't put the rotator too far up), I had to limit the mast to 4.5m as the weight is just too much to raise safely on my own. This height puts the boom at about 3.5-4m agl, as the boom is long enough to need stays, meaning that there needs to be sufficient height above the boom for the stays to attach to the mast. This reduced height probably had an impact on performance too.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="UKAC"></category><category term="Activation"></category></entry><entry><title>Rules for a Good Callsign</title><link href="https://m5mat.github.io/rules-for-a-good-callsign.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-10-14T23:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2019-10-14T23:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Matt, 2E1HNK</name></author><id>tag:m5mat.github.io,2019-10-14:/rules-for-a-good-callsign.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Having passed my full license exam, and now that you can essentially pick whichever (unissued) callsign you want, my mind has turned to trying to work out how to define a 'good' callsign. What I settled on is...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Callsign should not contain character combinations that are used for other purposes …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Having passed my full license exam, and now that you can essentially pick whichever (unissued) callsign you want, my mind has turned to trying to work out how to define a 'good' callsign. What I settled on is...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Callsign should not contain character combinations that are used for other purposes, e.g. 'CQ'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Callsign should not end in 'K', as that could be confusing in Morse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Morse, shorter (i.e. fewer dots and dashes) is better, and dorts are shorter than dashes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Callsign prefix should have originally been issed during a plausible time period. G3xxx was originally issued between 1946 and 1971 - it might be odd for someone who was born in the 1980's to be issued one of these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other considerations include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is the callsign should be available to register on social media/other online services such as Twitter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is the callsign available as a personalised number plate?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would having a newer-style 'short call' cause more problems than it's worth? More likely that people ask for repeats, believing that they have not copied the whole callsign, or refusing to work me believing me to be a pirate. Also some of the 'old timers' might be of the opinion that short calls shouldn't have been issued and refuse to work it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given all this, my shortlist at the moment is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M5MC&lt;/strong&gt; (-- ..... -- -.-.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M0MC&lt;/strong&gt; (-- ----- -- -.-.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

They define the physical and electrical characteristics of interconnections, such that two systems both implementing the same standard are able to connect to each other and interoperate without any concern about misunderstanding. Given that amateur radio deployments often consist of multiple different 'boxes' which need to be connected, it seems sensible to adhere to standards where possible. This is a list of the standards which I adhere to. It is primarily for my own reference although if anyone else decides to adopt these standards then that's great. In most cases I've tried to use publically-available already-published standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wherever possible equipment should run off 13.8VDC. Connections will be via 30A powerpole connectors wired to the &lt;a href="http://www.westmountainradio.com/kb_view_topic.php?id=ST166"&gt;ARES/RACES standard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where connection to domestic 230VAC mains power is required then the UK mains connectors will be used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Antenna connectors&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For frequencies above 100MHz, N-Type connectors will be used. For frequencies below 100MHz, SO239/PL259 connectors will be used. In some cases BNC connections are used. This should be restricted to specific deployment scenarios (typically portable) and in all cases an appropriate adapted should be on hand to convert to the standard connector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following is text that has been copied from Emsystech's website after being auto-translated by Google, as the original was in German which I don't understand. It has been lightly edited to remove information that is either no longer relevant or refers to websites/products that can no longer be found and to include additional information that was not originally provided (or available to) Emsystech. This includes projects that have implemented support for the module in other programming languages. I have also corrected some of Google Translate idiosyncrasies. I've kept it here for my own reference, and to assist anyone else who may have purchased these modules and is struggling to find information on them. I can't offer any support on the product itself, other than by providing the information present here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this module, a Raspberry Pi can be extended by a display and buttons. For many applications, a typical PC monitor and keyboard is too large and unwieldy. This gap closes the Raspi LCD. Projects such as web radios, streaming clients, home automation systems, ... can use this hardware. The circuit and a source code in C are available as open source. The basic "driver functionality" and necessary hardware access functions are implemented in this sample application. The keyboard area can be equipped with various buttons or separated. On the back of pads for receiving pin headers are already provided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The display used or its &lt;a href="/media/pdf/NT7532.pdf"&gt;graphic controller&lt;/a&gt; is connected via SPI interface. In the current version this is emulated in the software (-&amp;gt; no driver necessary). The display with its 128 x 64 pixels is in principle a 1kByte large memory, with which each bit corresponds to a pixel. In the software, the coordinates (x / y) correspond to the top left corner (0/0) and bottom right (127/63). Since the smallest organizational unit is one byte, 8 pixels are always transmitted and stored together. The least significant bit of the first byte is the origin in the upper left corner. Then follow for all 1024 bytes, the bits: D1 = (0/1), ... D7 = (0/7), etc. Since the memory of the display only describe, but not read, there is a small problem with the pixel-wise Presentation. Should a function change a single pixel, The other 7 bits of the associated byte must also be transferred. For this reason, a so-called frame buffer is implemented in the software. This is a 1: 1 memory image of the display. All operations are done with the framebuffer. With the function &lt;code&gt;LCD_WriteFramebuffer();&lt;/code&gt; then the output and display is done on the display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Output of the text "Hello World":&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;LCD_SetFont(0);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drawing a rectangle with transparent fill and two pixel line width:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;LCD_SetFillColor(-1);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;LCD_DrawRect(10,10,100,40,1);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Bitmaps can be converted to C arrays using the BMP2C V1.0 program  . eg: &lt;code&gt;const uint8 bmp_raspi [458] = {57, 64, 0×00, ... 0×00};&lt;/code&gt;
Output of bitmap at position(0/0):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;LCD_DrawBitmap(0,0, bmp_raspi);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h1&gt;Buttons&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The individual keys switch to ground when the key is pressed. Since the corresponding GPIO PINs are configured as an input with pullup, a depressed key means logical 0, an unpressed key logical 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The function &lt;code&gt;UpdateButtons();&lt;/code&gt; ensures that the state of the buttons is stored in the two variables ButtonPressed and Button as one bit each. Macros such as: &lt;code&gt;BUTTON_PRESSED_UP&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;BUTTON_PRESSED_RIGHT&lt;/code&gt;, ... allow comfortable use of the keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Backlight&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the Raspi LCD there is a switching transistor for controlling the LED background illumination. The corresponding GPIO pin can be set via the function &lt;code&gt;SetBacklight();&lt;/code&gt; be controlled.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Suppliers</title><link href="https://m5mat.github.io/suppliers.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-04-10T23:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2019-04-10T23:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Matt, M5MAT</name></author><id>tag:m5mat.github.io,2019-04-10:/suppliers.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Antenna Parts&lt;/h2&gt;

I was down on Burson Moor in Cornwall (IO70sw) and taking down the station whilst in a 'afflicted' state was no fun at all. The less said about that the better. 70cm was much better, although RF conditions were challenging and the WX was not great either - no rain but high winds and bitterly cold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having been in touch with Mark M0RKX during the week, I used his regular site in IO92ba as he's not able to get out for the 2m and 70cm event for the time being. I was interested in how this site compared to my regular site at Sudeley Hill in IO91aw. Access at Mark's site is better - the ground is firmer and there is a very stout gatepost to lash a mast too, additionally he has explicit permission from the farmer to be there. RF-wise - my initial impression was that Sudeley Hill was actually better, although I'm fairly certain that prevailing RF conditions played more of a part that the site itself. Mark's site certainly should be better (slightly more elevated and actually on the crest of a hill, rather than just off it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DX (GD8EXI on the Isle of Man) had to be fought for, with plenty of patience on both ends - I'm pretty certain we only managed it with the help of aircraft reflections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully next month will bring better conditions all round!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="UKAC"></category><category term="Activation"></category></entry><entry><title>2m UKAC February 2019</title><link href="https://m5mat.github.io/2m-ukac-february-2019.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-02-12T23:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-02-12T23:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Matt, 2E1HNK</name></author><id>tag:m5mat.github.io,2019-02-12:/2m-ukac-february-2019.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This month I managed to take part in both the 2m and 70cm sections.

hadn't had a chance to test (or even tune) beforehand. Fortunately I had a borrowed Bird 43 wattmeter with me which
at least allowed me to do some basic tuning with. Having filed down the DE a bit to get the SWR as low as possible
I set up the mast and got going. Problems were obvious from the outset with strong stations such as G1YBB and G4ASR
being barely readable, and them not being able to hear me at all. After some investigation I discovered that in putting the mast up I had obviously put some strain on the N-connector on the yagi which had caused the centre pin to not connect with
the centre of the coax. It didn't help that I had to use an N connector that was for RG213 on my Ultraflex-7 coax. I considered
just calling it a night but realised that I had sufficient items to effect a field repair along the lines of 'take all
the connectors off and use electrical tape to make the connections'. Surprisingly, this actually worked quite well and
so I could get on and work the rest of the contest, albeit with a SWR of about 2.1:1.&lt;/p&gt;

seemed to be harder work than it should have been, given that I was
using a much better antenna than normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sudeley Hill is a good location, possibly not quite as good as Cutsdean
Hill RF-wise but there is more space to set up antennas and to actually
get the car off the road. Got some interesting looks form passers-by and
one stopped to chat, who happened to be a G8 from Cheltenham who was out
on his bike!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't get on the air with enough time to make an impact on FMAC (currently
in last place) but was reasonably busy for the whole of the UKAC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beam was mounted on 2 sections of mast, giving a height of 3m. The mast
was braced against the side of the car putting the antenna about 1.2m above
the car, which probably isn't high enough. Plan for next time is to use 3 or 4
sections of mast putting the antenna at 4.5m or 6m AGL, however the two sections
that I used this time refused to come apart again. As it happens I can just
about fit the two sections in the car fitted together, however that won't work

That is to say that it would find 'good' sites which were elevate and had road access but which might also have other land around which is more elevated than the site itself (think of something like a mountain pass - elevated but probably going between two large mountains). This update should resolve that by excluding any sites which have any features with a greated elevation within 2km of the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Cutsdean Hill is a good location RF-wise, however there isn't much space for parking and antennas. I lashed the mast to a convenient fence post but that wouldn't have worked for a yagi as the trees would have got in the way. A guyed mast would be needed, however there isn't much space on the verge for guys.&lt;/li&gt;

knowledge, anecdotal evidence from other amateurs, plenty of
experimentation and a good dose of luck. Whilst there's nothing
wrong with this approach it does rely on either knowing the local
area well, or having contact with someone who does. This isn't
always available, for example holiday operation, moving to a new
area or simply that all the good peaks have been taken. There must
be a better way...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My approach to finding new hilltops to
activate involves finding candidate hilltops, assessing whether
operation is possible from that location, and then working out
whether it's worth the effort of attempting to activate it. These
are some of the resources I use to do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Find Candidate Sites&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Overpass Turbo&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://overpass-turbo.eu"&gt;Overpass Turbo&lt;/a&gt; allows users to run scripts against the Overpass API, part
of the OpenStreetMap project. The script below finds ways, nodes
and relationships (i.e. any object) with an elevation greater
than 300m a.s.l (which works well for the area I'm interested in,
depending on your local area you might need to change this). It
then searches the area around those objects up to a radius to
100m (you can tune this too, if you need to) to see if there are
any highways, but excluding footpaths, bridleways, tracks,
service roads, unclassified roads etc. This theoretically returns
a list/map of summits which are accessible by car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="json"&gt;
[out:json][timeout:800];
(
  way({{bbox}})(if:t["ele"] &gt; 300);
  node({{bbox}})(if:t["ele"] &gt; 300);
  rel({{bbox}})(if:t["ele"] &gt; 300);
)-&gt;.summits;

way
  (around.summits:100)
  [highway]
  [highway!~"^(footway|path|bridleway|track|unclassified|cycleway|service)$"]
-&gt;.streets;

(
  node.summits(around.streets:100);
  way.summits(around.streets:100);
  rel.summits(around.streets:100);
)-&gt;.matchingSummits;

(.matchingSummits; .streets;);
out geom;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;UKACMap&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="ukacmap.html"&gt;UKACMap&lt;/a&gt; queries the Google
Maps API to try to find the highest point in view. In some ways
this is more reliable that the OverPass API approach as the
Google Maps elevation data comes from surveys rather than
user-entered data, however there are limitations in how many
times the Google Maps API can be queried, so the application is
not as accurate as it could be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Assess Accessability&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the land privately owned?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is it possible to get a vehicle to the site?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are there time restrictions (for example a car park that closes at dusk)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there sufficient space to set up antennas?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answers to many of these questions can be found using online
mapping services including &lt;a href="https://www.bing.com/maps"&gt;Bing Maps&lt;/a&gt; which has Ordnance Survey maps available and Google Maps
which has aerial photography and also Google's fantastic Street
View service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Assess Radio Coverage&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of cource there's no point investing time and energy into
climbing a peak is it's not going to give you the coverage you
need.
&lt;a href="http://www.ve2dbe.com/rmonline.html"&gt;Radio Mobile Online&lt;/a&gt; (and also the offline version) and Splat! are fantastic
tools for assessing a site's radio coverage. Their use cannot be
described briefly here but there are plenty of tutorials
available. One I particularly like for Radio Mobile's offline
versions can be found &lt;a href="http://radiomobile.pe1mew.nl/?How_to:A_first_example"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Yaesu FT-857d Power Output Stuck</title><link href="https://m5mat.github.io/yaesu-ft-857d-power-output-stuck.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-04-04T23:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2018-04-04T23:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Matt, 2E1HNK</name></author><id>tag:m5mat.github.io,2018-04-04:/yaesu-ft-857d-power-output-stuck.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Yaesu FT-857d" src="[[images/ysu-ft-857d_xl.jpg]]"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, despite being /P, I
was in an area with good mobile coverage I had a quick google and
although I found a few others who had experienced a few similar
&lt;a href="http://www.eham.net/ehamforum/smf/index.php?topic=74837.0"&gt;issues&lt;/a&gt;,
there was only one viable suggestion for resolving the problem,
which was to perform a reset. There are three variations of reset
available on an FT857d detailed &lt;a href="https://www.hamradio.hanklambert.com/8-ham-radio/23-yaesu-ft-857d-reset-procedures"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
It was the FUNC + PWR one that worked for me, however it wasn't
clear to me that this is a power-on reset, so the rig has to be off
for it to work. There is a sort of 'confirmation beep' to indicate
that the memory has been reset and you'll also notice that the VFO
will probably have changed (in my case it reset to 7MHz).&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>2m FMAC April 2018</title><link href="https://m5mat.github.io/2m-fmac-april-2018.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-04-03T23:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2018-04-03T23:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Matt, 2E1HNK</name></author><id>tag:m5mat.github.io,2018-04-03:/2m-fmac-april-2018.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Participated in both the 2m FMAC and UKAC events with a family meal

either had other commitments or Alcester-Dudley was a no-go.
Operated from the car park of the Moat House, Alcester (IO92BF, 21m
asl) using a Baofeng UV5R and the 2m/70cm mini magnetic whip that I
picked up in the Maplin closing-down sale a few weeks ago. I
started operating for the UKAC at about 9pm (2000 UTC), having
missed the first hour of the contest due to family commitments. I
made 11 contacts across 4 grid squares with the best DX being
G0HEL/P in IO81WG at about 107km - not too bad off a vertical.
Operating location was chosen primarily for its proximity to my
route home from the restaurant and was a lay-by off the B4088 just
south of the junction with the A422 (IO92AF, 122m asl). It was
surprisingly comfortable with the lay-by being set back from the
road and separated from it by some trees. This reduced the sound of
passing vehicles (not that there were many) and reduced the chance
of muggles taking an interest. This was the first outing for both
my Yaesu FT857d and Diamond X200. There was a small issue with the
FT857d (&lt;a href="/blog/TechNote/1.html"&gt;see TechNote#1&lt;/a&gt;) but
that was resolved on-site. The setup performed well, but has left
me wanting a 2m Yagi! The next problem that I encountered was when
I tried to submit the log the following day - I submitted it fine
but got an email enquiring about my RSGB membership status - I
hadn't realised that membership was a prerequisite for entering.&lt;/p&gt;
