&lt;li&gt;The antenna was swinging on the mast, so anything up to about 30&amp;deg; out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;About 10 minutes after the start, the voltage at the rig started dropping to about 10V after a couple of seconds of transmit. This causes the rig to either FM or to just cut out completely. The voltmeter on by ignition-sense disconnect box wasn't showing a problem. I didn't manage to properly diagnose the problem but feeding the system from the cigar lighter socket seemed to fix the problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In messing about with the power, I lost audio to the right side of my headphones. This is annoying but not a deal-breaker so I pressed on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'm not convinced that the radiation pattern of the antenna is particularly good. This is hard to judge given that I wasn't sure where the antenna was actually pointing, but I did seem to work more people who were about 30&amp;deg; off the centre of the beam (taking into account the fact that it wasn't point where it should have been), or about 120&amp;deg; off.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Got off to a late start as I tried to put up a 9m mast to take best advantage of the forecast tropo enhancement. The mast had other ideas and effected an uncontrolled descent. This bent one of the elements but not too severely, so it didn't take long to bend it back and put the mast up at the usual 6m. I missed the first 15 minutes of the contest but go off to a good start nontheless. After running for about 20 mins I was approached by a gentleman hiking, who turned out to have passed the RAE at university but was unlicensed. He was attempting to return home (to Devon!) and was a bit stuck. I sorted a taxi out for him which cost me 10 minutes or so.

&lt;p&gt;This was the first appearance of my newly-finished 23-element yagi. Unfortunately conditions were not good so there wasn't much demonstrable improvement over the old 7-element one. An additional problem was that whilst it is quite easy to get the 7-element up to the full 6m mast height (and I think 9m might be quite straightforward too, if I don't put the rotator too far up), I had to limit the mast to 4.5m as the weight is just too much to raise safely on my own. This height puts the boom at about 3.5-4m agl, as the boom is long enough to need stays, meaning that there needs to be sufficient height above the boom for the stays to attach to the mast. This reduced height probably had an impact on performance too.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Contests"></category><category term="UKAC"></category><category term="Activation"></category></entry><entry><title>2m UKAC October 2019</title><link href="https://m5mat.github.io/2m-ukac-october-2019.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-10-03T23:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2019-10-03T23:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Matt, 2E1HNK</name></author><id>tag:m5mat.github.io,2019-10-03:/2m-ukac-october-2019.html</id><content type="html"></content><category term="Contests"></category><category term="UKAC"></category><category term="Activation"></category></entry><entry><title>70cm UKAC October 2019</title><link href="https://m5mat.github.io/70cm-ukac-october-2019.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-10-03T23:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2019-10-03T23:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Matt, 2E1HNK</name></author><id>tag:m5mat.github.io,2019-10-03:/70cm-ukac-october-2019.html</id><content type="html"></content><category term="Contests"></category><category term="UKAC"></category><category term="Activation"></category></entry><entry><title>2m UKAC September 2019</title><link href="https://m5mat.github.io/2m-ukac-september-2019.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-09-03T23:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2019-09-03T23:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Matt, 2E1HNK</name></author><id>tag:m5mat.github.io,2019-09-03:/2m-ukac-september-2019.html</id><content type="html"></content><category term="Contests"></category><category term="UKAC"></category><category term="Activation"></category></entry><entry><title>70cm UKAC September 2019</title><link href="https://m5mat.github.io/70cm-ukac-september-2019.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-09-03T23:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2019-09-03T23:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Matt, 2E1HNK</name></author><id>tag:m5mat.github.io,2019-09-03:/70cm-ukac-september-2019.html</id><content type="html"></content><category term="Contests"></category><category term="UKAC"></category><category term="Activation"></category></entry><entry><title>2m UKAC August 2019</title><link href="https://m5mat.github.io/2m-ukac-august-2019.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-08-13T23:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2019-08-13T23:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Matt, 2E1HNK</name></author><id>tag:m5mat.github.io,2019-08-13:/2m-ukac-august-2019.html</id><content type="html"></content><category term="Contests"></category><category term="UKAC"></category><category term="Activation"></category></entry><entry><title>70cm UKAC August 2019</title><link href="https://m5mat.github.io/70cm-ukac-august-2019.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-08-13T23:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2019-08-13T23:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Matt, 2E1HNK</name></author><id>tag:m5mat.github.io,2019-08-13:/70cm-ukac-august-2019.html</id><content type="html"></content><category term="Contests"></category><category term="UKAC"></category><category term="Activation"></category></entry><entry><title>2m UKAC July 2019</title><link href="https://m5mat.github.io/2m-ukac-july-2019.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-07-09T23:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2019-07-09T23:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Matt, 2E1HNK</name></author><id>tag:m5mat.github.io,2019-07-09:/2m-ukac-july-2019.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The first 10 minutes of the 2M contest were absolutely cracking with Es propagation to Italy.

I was down on Burson Moor in Cornwall (IO70sw) and taking down the station whilst in a 'afflicted' state was no fun at all. The less said about that the better. 70cm was much better, although RF conditions were challenging and the WX was not great either - no rain but high winds and bitterly cold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having been in touch with Mark M0RKX during the week, I used his regular site in IO92ba as he's not able to get out for the 2m and 70cm event for the time being. I was interested in how this site compared to my regular site at Sudeley Hill in IO91aw. Access at Mark's site is better - the ground is firmer and there is a very stout gatepost to lash a mast too, additionally he has explicit permission from the farmer to be there. RF-wise - my initial impression was that Sudeley Hill was actually better, although I'm fairly certain that prevailing RF conditions played more of a part that the site itself. Mark's site certainly should be better (slightly more elevated and actually on the crest of a hill, rather than just off it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DX (GD8EXI on the Isle of Man) had to be fought for, with plenty of patience on both ends - I'm pretty certain we only managed it with the help of aircraft reflections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully next month will bring better conditions all round!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Contests"></category><category term="UKAC"></category><category term="Activation"></category></entry><entry><title>2m UKAC February 2019</title><link href="https://m5mat.github.io/2m-ukac-february-2019.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-02-12T23:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-02-12T23:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Matt, 2E1HNK</name></author><id>tag:m5mat.github.io,2019-02-12:/2m-ukac-february-2019.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This month I managed to take part in both the 2m and 70cm sections.

&lt;p&gt;I was using my newly-constructed 7-element DK7ZB yagi which I
hadn't had a chance to test (or even tune) beforehand. Fortunately I had a borrowed Bird 43 wattmeter with me which
at least allowed me to do some basic tuning with. Having filed down the DE a bit to get the SWR as low as possible
I set up the mast and got going. Problems were obvious from the outset with strong stations such as G1YBB and G4ASR
being barely readable, and them not being able to hear me at all. After some investigation I discovered that in putting the mast up I had obviously put some strain on the N-connector on the yagi which had caused the centre pin to not connect with
the centre of the coax. It didn't help that I had to use an N connector that was for RG213 on my Ultraflex-7 coax. I considered
just calling it a night but realised that I had sufficient items to effect a field repair along the lines of 'take all
the connectors off and use electrical tape to make the connections'. Surprisingly, this actually worked quite well and
so I could get on and work the rest of the contest, albeit with a SWR of about 2.1:1.&lt;/p&gt;

borrowed 8 element yagi for UKAC. Generally a good evening however it
seemed to be harder work than it should have been, given that I was
using a much better antenna than normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sudeley Hill is a good location, possibly not quite as good as Cutsdean
Hill RF-wise but there is more space to set up antennas and to actually
get the car off the road. Got some interesting looks form passers-by and
one stopped to chat, who happened to be a G8 from Cheltenham who was out
on his bike!&lt;/p&gt;

in last place) but was reasonably busy for the whole of the UKAC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beam was mounted on 2 sections of mast, giving a height of 3m. The mast
was braced against the side of the car putting the antenna about 1.2m above
the car, which probably isn't high enough. Plan for next time is to use 3 or 4
sections of mast putting the antenna at 4.5m or 6m AGL, however the two sections
that I used this time refused to come apart again. As it happens I can just
about fit the two sections in the car fitted together, however that won't work
if more sections get stuck!&lt;/p&gt;

M0RKX/P. I was hoping to get M0RSD too as I’d heard him a few
minutes earlier doing a demo for some foundation students but he
either had other commitments or Alcester-Dudley was a no-go.
Operated from the car park of the Moat House, Alcester (IO92BF, 21m
asl) using a Baofeng UV5R and the 2m/70cm mini magnetic whip that I
picked up in the Maplin closing-down sale a few weeks ago. I
started operating for the UKAC at about 9pm (2000 UTC), having
missed the first hour of the contest due to family commitments. I
made 11 contacts across 4 grid squares with the best DX being
G0HEL/P in IO81WG at about 107km - not too bad off a vertical.
Operating location was chosen primarily for its proximity to my
route home from the restaurant and was a lay-by off the B4088 just
south of the junction with the A422 (IO92AF, 122m asl). It was
surprisingly comfortable with the lay-by being set back from the
road and separated from it by some trees. This reduced the sound of
passing vehicles (not that there were many) and reduced the chance
of muggles taking an interest. This was the first outing for both
my Yaesu FT857d and Diamond X200. There was a small issue with the
FT857d (&lt;a href="/blog/TechNote/1.html"&gt;see TechNote#1&lt;/a&gt;) but
that was resolved on-site. The setup performed well, but has left
me wanting a 2m Yagi! The next problem that I encountered was when
I tried to submit the log the following day - I submitted it fine
but got an email enquiring about my RSGB membership status - I
hadn't realised that membership was a prerequisite for entering.&lt;/p&gt;

that was resolved on-site. The setup performed well, but has left
me wanting a 2m Yagi! The next problem that I encountered was when
I tried to submit the log the following day - I submitted it fine
but got an email enquiring about my RSGB membership status - I
hadn't realised that membership was a prerequisite for entering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total QSOs: 1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total Points: 24&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normalised Points: 143&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ODX: M0RKX/P (IO92BA - 24km)&lt;/p&gt;
