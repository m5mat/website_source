Most of my radio kit lives in the car most of the time for UKAC contests, and general commuter-mobile use. As that won't be happening for the foreseeable future I've moved the FT-857d into the garage, hooked it up to a G5RV Jr antenna which is strung up in the roof of the garage (via my YT-100 tuner) and also to an X200 dual-band colinear. The G5RV is all of 3m agl (possibly 4m if I'm being generous) with significantly folded ends and the base of the colinear is at 1.5m agl. This isn't ideal but it's better than being unused in the car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that I'm also working from home and we're home-schooling the two kids I don't have time to sit in from of the rig, so it's set up from remote access and use on data modes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FT-8 has been my go-to HF data mode for a while but as I hadn't used it in over a year there was an update available for WSJT-X. I duly updated from 2.0.0 to 2.1.2 and it sort of doesn't work now. It works a bit but within a few cycles the decodes stop - they do sometimes come back again later but not always. TX-ing seems to make things worse too. The usual culprits (audio level &amp;amp; time sync) seem to be ok so not sure what's going on there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of WSJT-X not playing ball I've been using PSK31 on FLDigi - something I last played with during JOTA in about 1999/2000. It's been pleasantly refreshing, and compared to FT8 actually feels quite fast!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite having an auto-tuner in, I can't remotely trigger a tuning cycle, so I'm stuck on one band until I can nip out to the garage to re-tune. I've been using 40m for a few days and just switched over to 20m for a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've also been running WSPR overnight. WSPR still seems to have reasonable usage but the WSPRnet seems to be suffering - most of the time my reports fail to get logged which implies the infrastructure on their end is creaking a bit. The WSPRnet forum is full of unanswered posts about this problem (and also unanswered posts offering to help with infrastructure).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One interesting problem I've come across is that the audio level expected by FLDigi, WSJT-X and WSPR all seem to be different. In order to change this remotely you have to go into the microphone properties - which I can never find (hurray for Win10 making things easy...). After a bit of poking around I found a PowerShell AudioDeviceCmdlets thing (https://github.com/frgnca/AudioDeviceCmdlets) which allows you to change the audio level via a script. I just leave a powershell window running in the background and run &lt;code&gt;Set-AudioDevice -RecordingVolume xx&lt;/code&gt; with the appropriate level (FLDigi - 80, WSPR - 18, WSJT-X - 67).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was also a little unsure about how the rig was behaving (i.e. was it actually transmitting? Has it stopped transmitting? etc.) so I've set up a webcam pointing at the front of the rig (and also the tuner, for getting feedback when I get round to making a remote interface for it). At the moment this is only visible within my home network but I may open it up to the world at some point. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Blog"></category></entry><entry><title>GPS and SMS messaging via APRS on Motorola MotoTRBO radios</title><link href="https://m5mat.github.io/gps-and-sms-messaging-via-aprs-on-motorola-mototrbo-radios.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-01-21T12:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-01-21T12:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Matt, M5MAT</name></author><id>tag:m5mat.github.io,2020-01-21:/gps-and-sms-messaging-via-aprs-on-motorola-mototrbo-radios.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The following information is mostly derived from a &lt;a href="https://www.hamdigitaal.nl/download/algemene-informatie/GPS_Motorola_BM262.pdf"&gt;hamdigitaal.nl&lt;/a&gt; article and is only for use on the &lt;strong&gt;Brandmeister Network&lt;/strong&gt; - this will not work on Phoenix UK or any other networks.&lt;/p&gt;

The ID that we need to use is the first three digits of this id, with &lt;code&gt;999&lt;/code&gt; added, so &lt;code&gt;234999&lt;/code&gt; for the UK (USA: &lt;code&gt;310999&lt;/code&gt;, France: &lt;code&gt;208999&lt;/code&gt; etc.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note 1:&lt;/strong&gt; there is still quite a lot of old info about this on the internet. ID &lt;code&gt;5057&lt;/code&gt; is no longer in use on Brandmeister. If you read an article that uses this ID then you're either reading an out-of-date article, or one about the Phoenix UK Network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;GPS setup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To enable GPS, select the &lt;code&gt;GPS&lt;/code&gt; tickbox in &lt;code&gt;General Settings&lt;/code&gt;. Reports suggest that changing the GNSS setting to include GLONASS also helps with fix-times - presumable this is a European thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;code&gt;General Settings -&amp;gt; Persistent LRRP Requests&lt;/code&gt;, set &lt;code&gt;Persistent LRRP Requests&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;Save&lt;/code&gt; - this makes APRS updates more reliable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Testing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the radio is sending position reports, then your callsign should show up on &lt;a href="http://aprs.fi"&gt;aprs.fi&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can try sending an SMS message to your radio by using &lt;a href="http://www.findu.com/cgi-bin/entermsg.cgi?"&gt;findu.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To send a message from your radio to APRS, send an SMS to the master id (&lt;code&gt;234999&lt;/code&gt; for the UK, it might be worth storing this as a contact). The format of the message must be the destination callsign (with SSID), followed by a space, followed by the test of the message, e.g. &lt;code&gt;M5MAT-10 Hello Matt!&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bit of a warning to those who intend to upgrade or otherwise change callsign, and care about your UKAC results... You need to do it at the end of a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I upgraded to a full license a the RSGB Convention last year. Due to errors at Ofcom I've been issued a few different callsigns over the last few months (full details &lt;a href="https://m5mat.github.io/m5mat.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, in case you're interested). I entered the January 2m UKAC using my then-valid callsign M0IZZ. That's no longer my callsign - it's now M5MAT - but what I didn't anticipate is that UKAC results are tied to a callsign, not to an individual so even though M0IZZ was me, I can't have credit for my Jan 2m entry in the overall 2m and overall UKAC results. Interestingly if M0IZZ is re-issued within the year, which it can be - my G2KS callsign has been re-issued, whoever gets it will inherit my Jan 2m credit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I accept that how this situation arose in my case is slightly odd, however it's entirely possible that someone upgrading from Foundation to Intermediate or Intermediate to Full (or indeed going through the whole set over the course of a year) could be disadvantaged if they choose to surrender their old licence, as we're encouraged to do.&lt;/p&gt;

After the result was confirmed I filled in a paper application so that I could request a specific callsign - M5MAT (the online system doesn't allow you to request a particular callsign).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as I could tell that callsign was available - it wasn't registered on QRZ.com, it didn't come up as being assigned in recent Ofcom FoIA responses and nothing showed up when searching for it on Google, Twitter etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After paying the £20 fee Ofcom were happy to confirm that I had been issued the callsign G2KS. Err, wot?!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's obviously not the callsign I requested, but it's also not from the M0 range which they should have issued if the callsign that I had requested was not available. This didn't make any sense, so I phoned them up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've always found the people on the phones at Ofcom to be really helpful and this time was no different. I explained what had happened and that I was confused about the callsign I had been issued. They dug out the paperwork and confirmed that I had requested G2KS and had therefore been issued it. I told them that this simply wasn't the case and I suspected that paperwork may have been inadvertently shuffled so could they please compare handwriting or something. Apparently whoever had applied for G2KS had sufficiently different handwriting to me to make it obvious that the paperwork had been mixed up somehow. They informed me that they'd need to go via their policy people to get it resolved. Lo and behold, a couple of days later G2KS was revoked and I was issued with M0IZZ. This was still not what I had requested but obviously M5MAT was not available for some reason so they had issued me with the next available M0 callsign. I was annoyed that I didn't get my choice but there you go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All sorted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or was it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Looks like in a recent FoI &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Ofcom?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@ofcom&lt;/a&gt; provided a list of valid ham radio callsigns as of Sept 2019 minus personal info &lt;a href="https://t.co/X5rqVW7af4"&gt;https://t.co/X5rqVW7af4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Peter Goodhall (2M0SQL) (@2m0sql) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/2m0sql/status/1213444497880866817?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 4, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A tweet from 2M0SQL alerted me to a more recent FoIA response from Ofcom which was published in September 2019. M5MAT didn't show as assigned in this list. The chance of that callsign being issued in the period between the list being published and me requesting it was pretty small, so I phoned up Ofcom and re-explained the situation. They confirmed that M5MAT was still available and that they would have to speak to their policy people - I guess their policy department must be one of the busier departments there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of days later I received a slightly concerning email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My full license had been revoked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No other explanation, nothing about another one being issued or anything like that. By the time I had the email and phoned them up their helpdesk was closed too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I logged in to the licensing portal and my old intermediate license was there but nothing about a full one. It dawned on me that when I was originally issued with my G2KS callsign I had to pay an invoice via the licensing portal. I didn't get an email or any other notification to tell me that I needed to pay, the invoice just silently appeared and sat there. I eventually found my way back to that part of the portal (it's not very obvious) and there was another invoice for me to pay. I had hoped that I wouldn't need to pay anything extra - I'd already payed the £20 fee once - but at least its not too much. Once I paid it I was issued M5MAT and there we go, 4 callsigns (including my intermediate one) in 4 months and the reason why I've popped up during UKAC contests in multiple different guises recently.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Blog"></category><category term="license"></category><category term="M5MAT"></category></entry><entry><title>2019 Wrap-up</title><link href="https://m5mat.github.io/2019-wrap-up.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-12-31T23:59:59+00:00</published><updated>2019-12-31T23:59:59+00:00</updated><author><name>Matt, M5MAT</name></author><id>tag:m5mat.github.io,2019-12-31:/2019-wrap-up.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Stats&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;G3MXH&lt;/em&gt; (2019-08-06) - Terry, G3MXH helped me pass my novice exam 20-odd years ago and did much to help my enthusiasm for amateur radio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I7CSB&lt;/em&gt; (2019-07-02) - A 2m SSB contact using just 10W to an 8-element yagi over 1736km. Nothing un-remarkable about that! Sporadic E might have had a part in this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;9M4SJJJ&lt;/em&gt; (2019-10-19) - The first contact of JOTA 2019 from GB1WSG was with 9M4SJJJ in Malasia. We used DMR for this and some of our youngsters got to talk to youngsters there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;G0ABI&lt;/em&gt; (2019-06-09) - When I was a newly-licensed novice, the idea of satellites interested me, but they seemed difficult to get my head round, I also wasn't too sure whether or not novices were allowed to use satellites at the time. Well Intermediates definitly can, and I did. Pete will probably be the one and only person to contact 2E1HNK via satellite as I'll be using MØIZZ now. This QSO was FM via SO-50.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of my operating this year was in the RSGB UKAC series of contests - much like last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other notable events included running JOTA for 1st Woodmancote Scouts, which saw approximately 70 youngsters get their first&amp;ast; introduction to Amateur Radio. The village also now has 70 more morse keys and buzzers in circulation than it did before, so apologies to the parents...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last, and not least, I passed my full license exam and became MØIZZ (&lt;em&gt;edit: and then M5MAT&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ast; It wasn't the first for all - some were already aware of amateur radio, and two have been pointed in the direction of the local club to hopefully get a foundation license.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Blog"></category></entry><entry><title>MØIZZ</title><link href="https://m5mat.github.io/moizz.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-11-19T12:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-11-19T12:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Matt, MØIZZ</name></author><id>tag:m5mat.github.io,2019-11-19:/moizz.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm now MØIZZ!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;

What I settled on is...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Callsign should not contain character combinations that are used for other purposes, e.g. 'CQ'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Callsign should not end in 'K', as that could be confusing in Morse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Morse, shorter (i.e. fewer dots and dashes) is better, and dorts are shorter than dashes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Callsign prefix should have originally been issed during a plausible time period. G3xxx was originally issued between 1946 and 1971 - it might be odd for someone who was born in the 1980's to be issued one of these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other considerations include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is the callsign should be available to register on social media/other online services such as Twitter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is the callsign available as a personalised number plate?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would having a newer-style 'short call' cause more problems than it's worth? More likely that people ask for repeats, believing that they have not copied the whole callsign, or refusing to work me believing me to be a pirate. Also some of the 'old timers' might be of the opinion that short calls shouldn't have been issued and refuse to work it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given all this, my shortlist at the moment is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M5MC&lt;/strong&gt; (-- ..... -- -.-.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

They define the physical and electrical characteristics of interconnections, such that two systems both implementing the same standard are able to connect to each other and interoperate without any concern about misunderstanding. Given that amateur radio deployments often consist of multiple different 'boxes' which need to be connected, it seems sensible to adhere to standards where possible. This is a list of the standards which I adhere to. It is primarily for my own reference although if anyone else decides to adopt these standards then that's great. In most cases I've tried to use publically-available already-published standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wherever possible equipment should run off 13.8VDC. Connections will be via 30A powerpole connectors wired to the &lt;a href="http://www.westmountainradio.com/kb_view_topic.php?id=ST166"&gt;ARES/RACES standard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where connection to domestic 230VAC mains power is required then the UK mains connectors will be used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Antenna connectors&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For frequencies above 100MHz, N-Type connectors will be used. For frequencies below 100MHz, SO239/PL259 connectors will be used. In some cases BNC connections are used. This should be restricted to specific deployment scenarios (typically portable) and in all cases an appropriate adapted should be on hand to convert to the standard connector.&lt;/p&gt;

The company that produced these (Emsystech Engineering, Germany) no longer produce them and they no longer host information about them on their website. This is a mirror of the info that I've managed to collate from a number of sources, primarily the &lt;a href="https://archive.org/web/"&gt;Wayback Machine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following is text that has been copied from Emsystech's website after being auto-translated by Google, as the original was in German which I don't understand. It has been lightly edited to remove information that is either no longer relevant or refers to websites/products that can no longer be found and to include additional information that was not originally provided (or available to) Emsystech. This includes projects that have implemented support for the module in other programming languages. I have also corrected some of Google Translate idiosyncrasies. I've kept it here for my own reference, and to assist anyone else who may have purchased these modules and is struggling to find information on them. I can't offer any support on the product itself, other than by providing the information present here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this module, a Raspberry Pi can be extended by a display and buttons. For many applications, a typical PC monitor and keyboard is too large and unwieldy. This gap closes the Raspi LCD. Projects such as web radios, streaming clients, home automation systems, ... can use this hardware. The circuit and a source code in C are available as open source. The basic "driver functionality" and necessary hardware access functions are implemented in this sample application. The keyboard area can be equipped with various buttons or separated. On the back of pads for receiving pin headers are already provided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt text" src="/media/images/RaspiLCD-memory.png" title="RaspiLCD Memory"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The display used or its &lt;a href="/media/pdf/NT7532.pdf"&gt;graphic controller&lt;/a&gt; is connected via SPI interface. In the current version this is emulated in the software (-&amp;gt; no driver necessary). The display with its 128 x 64 pixels is in principle a 1kByte large memory, with which each bit corresponds to a pixel. In the software, the coordinates (x / y) correspond to the top left corner (0/0) and bottom right (127/63). Since the smallest organizational unit is one byte, 8 pixels are always transmitted and stored together. The least significant bit of the first byte is the origin in the upper left corner. Then follow for all 1024 bytes, the bits: D1 = (0/1), ... D7 = (0/7), etc. Since the memory of the display only describe, but not read, there is a small problem with the pixel-wise Presentation. Should a function change a single pixel, The other 7 bits of the associated byte must also be transferred. For this reason, a so-called frame buffer is implemented in the software. This is a 1: 1 memory image of the display. All operations are done with the framebuffer. With the function &lt;code&gt;LCD_WriteFramebuffer();&lt;/code&gt; then the output and display is done on the display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Output of the text "Hello World":&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;LCD_SetFont(0);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;LCD_PrintXY(0,0, &amp;quot;Hello World&amp;quot;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Drawing a rectangle with transparent fill and two pixel line width:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;LCD_SetFillColor(-1);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;LCD_DrawRect(10,10,100,40,1);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Bitmaps can be converted to C arrays using the BMP2C V1.0 program  . eg: &lt;code&gt;const uint8 bmp_raspi [458] = {57, 64, 0×00, ... 0×00};&lt;/code&gt;
Output of bitmap at position(0/0):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;LCD_DrawBitmap(0,0, bmp_raspi);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h1&gt;Buttons&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The individual keys switch to ground when the key is pressed. Since the corresponding GPIO PINs are configured as an input with pullup, a depressed key means logical 0, an unpressed key logical 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The function &lt;code&gt;UpdateButtons();&lt;/code&gt; ensures that the state of the buttons is stored in the two variables ButtonPressed and Button as one bit each. Macros such as: &lt;code&gt;BUTTON_PRESSED_UP&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;BUTTON_PRESSED_RIGHT&lt;/code&gt;, ... allow comfortable use of the keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Backlight&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the Raspi LCD there is a switching transistor for controlling the LED background illumination. The corresponding GPIO pin can be set via the function &lt;code&gt;SetBacklight();&lt;/code&gt; be controlled.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Blog"></category></entry><entry><title>2018 Wrap-up</title><link href="https://m5mat.github.io/2018-wrap-up.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-12-31T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-12-31T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Matt, 2E1HNK</name></author><id>tag:m5mat.github.io,2018-12-31:/2018-wrap-up.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Total QSOs - 615&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Overpass API code given in the original blog post didn't take into account the presence of points in the vacinity with a higher elevation that the point in question. That is to say that it would find 'good' sites which were elevate and had road access but which might also have other land around which is more elevated than the site itself (think of something like a mountain pass - elevated but probably going between two large mountains). This update should resolve that by excluding any sites which have any features with a greated elevation within 2km of the site.&lt;/p&gt;

knowledge, anecdotal evidence from other amateurs, plenty of
experimentation and a good dose of luck. Whilst there's nothing
wrong with this approach it does rely on either knowing the local
area well, or having contact with someone who does. This isn't
always available, for example holiday operation, moving to a new
area or simply that all the good peaks have been taken. There must
be a better way...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My approach to finding new hilltops to
activate involves finding candidate hilltops, assessing whether
operation is possible from that location, and then working out
whether it's worth the effort of attempting to activate it. These
are some of the resources I use to do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Find Candidate Sites&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Overpass Turbo&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://overpass-turbo.eu"&gt;Overpass Turbo&lt;/a&gt; allows users to run scripts against the Overpass API, part
of the OpenStreetMap project. The script below finds ways, nodes
and relationships (i.e. any object) with an elevation greater
than 300m a.s.l (which works well for the area I'm interested in,
depending on your local area you might need to change this). It
then searches the area around those objects up to a radius to
100m (you can tune this too, if you need to) to see if there are
any highways, but excluding footpaths, bridleways, tracks,
service roads, unclassified roads etc. This theoretically returns
a list/map of summits which are accessible by car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;UKACMap&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="ukacmap.html"&gt;UKACMap&lt;/a&gt; queries the Google
Maps API to try to find the highest point in view. In some ways
this is more reliable that the OverPass API approach as the
Google Maps elevation data comes from surveys rather than
user-entered data, however there are limitations in how many
times the Google Maps API can be queried, so the application is
not as accurate as it could be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Assess Accessability&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the land privately owned?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is it possible to get a vehicle to the site?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are there time restrictions (for example a car park that closes at dusk)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there sufficient space to set up antennas?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answers to many of these questions can be found using online
mapping services including &lt;a href="https://www.bing.com/maps"&gt;Bing Maps&lt;/a&gt; which has Ordnance Survey maps available and Google Maps
which has aerial photography and also Google's fantastic Street
View service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Assess Radio Coverage&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of cource there's no point investing time and energy into
climbing a peak is it's not going to give you the coverage you
need.
&lt;a href="http://www.ve2dbe.com/rmonline.html"&gt;Radio Mobile Online&lt;/a&gt; (and also the offline version) and Splat! are fantastic
tools for assessing a site's radio coverage. Their use cannot be
described briefly here but there are plenty of tutorials
available. One I particularly like for Radio Mobile's offline
versions can be found &lt;a href="http://radiomobile.pe1mew.nl/?How_to:A_first_example"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Blog"></category></entry><entry><title>Yaesu FT-857d Power Output Stuck</title><link href="https://m5mat.github.io/yaesu-ft-857d-power-output-stuck.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-04-04T23:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2018-04-04T23:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Matt, 2E1HNK</name></author><id>tag:m5mat.github.io,2018-04-04:/yaesu-ft-857d-power-output-stuck.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Yaesu FT-857d" src="[[images/ysu-ft-857d_xl.jpg]]"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I fired up my Yaesu FT857d to take part in the RSGB's April 2018 2m
UKAC Contest a couple of days ago to discover that the RF power
output (Menu Option 75) was stuck at 50W and wouldn't change by
rotating the VFO knob as it should.&lt;/p&gt;

rotating the VFO knob as it should.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, despite being /P, I
was in an area with good mobile coverage I had a quick google and
although I found a few others who had experienced a few similar
&lt;a href="http://www.eham.net/ehamforum/smf/index.php?topic=74837.0"&gt;issues&lt;/a&gt;,
there was only one viable suggestion for resolving the problem,
which was to perform a reset. There are three variations of reset
available on an FT857d detailed &lt;a href="https://www.hamradio.hanklambert.com/8-ham-radio/23-yaesu-ft-857d-reset-procedures"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
It was the FUNC + PWR one that worked for me, however it wasn't
clear to me that this is a power-on reset, so the rig has to be off
for it to work. There is a sort of 'confirmation beep' to indicate
that the memory has been reset and you'll also notice that the VFO
will probably have changed (in my case it reset to 7MHz).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Blog"></category></entry></feed>
