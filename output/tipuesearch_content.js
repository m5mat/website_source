Later on, in 2015 when I re-activated my license after having let it lapse, I was grandfathered on to an Intermediate license which allowed up to 50W on most bands, including HF (but excluding 60m and a few others).

Many thanks to John, G8HJS (SK, 2015) and Terry, G3MXH for helping me through the Novice exam. I let my license lapse in 2003 after having not used it for a while - mainly because I was a student and had no money for amateur radio trinkets :(. Fast-forward to 2015 and I re-activated my license, now as an Intermediate License. At the RSGB Convention in October 2019 I passed my Full License exam and, after a bit of a mix-up, was issued the callsign M5MAT (the mix-up is chronicled here ). At the moment my operating is mostly limited to going out portable for the RSGB FMAC and UKAC VHF/UHF contests although the rig typically lives in the car so if I'm on my own I often monitor local repeaters. I've also been known to operate HF SSB while mobile and occasionally DMR. QSL QSL via LoTW is preferred, eQSL is acceptable. I try to upload logs to LoTW regularly but if you're eager for a QSL then please feel free to prompt me to upload, Twitter is probably best.

What I do have up and running is as follows: An RTL-SDR dongle connected to a Diamond X200 2m/70cm co-linear 'white stick' antenna. The dongle is connected to a somewhat vintage (Centos 6) server and typically functions as an APRS iGate using Direwolf on the server. The antenna is mounted a whole 4' about the ground so the range is limited at best. The setup can be fairly easily re-purposed to fulfil other VHF/UHF monitoring duties and has been used to record the pilot audio from a Red Arrows pass, for example. A G5RV - this is mounted in the roof space of the detached garage. It is yet to actually be connected to a transceiver. The idea is that the FT-857d from my mobile setup could easily be attached to this, but it hasn't happened yet. The Shack Computer is an old Dell Optiplex 755 running Windows 10 and a bunch of Amateur Radio programs. The master log is kept in DXKeeper however I have issues with the chronically non-standard interface on this, so it may change at some point. I keep all logs as ADIF files in a OneDrive folder, which is sort of the actual master record but they're not very useable there. Ideally I'd like to use a cloud-based logging solution such as 2M0SQL's Cloudlog, I just haven't get round to setting it up yet. Car Most of my operating is mobile or car-portable. My car is a Mitsibushi L200 Pickup Truck which is being slowly kitted out as a mobile shack. The current state is as follows: My FT-857d lives in the car, it is either mounted on the mounting bracket which is attached to the rear bulkhead (behind the rear passanger seats), or pulled out to use more naturally for car-portable operation. There are 3 CAT5 cables, one pair of 25A power cables and one 3.5mm male - 3.5mm female cable running from the mounting location to the passenger footwell to allow control and audio routing to the front of the car. The power leads extend through the firewall and to the starter battery. The CAT5 leads are used for the mike and the front panel, with 1 spare, and the 3.5mm extension lead is used for speaker audio. There is also a Motorola GM350 programmed for 2m FM use in the car although that is not permanently connected. This may become an APRS setup at some point. It comes out of the car for JOTA (which is why it was bought in the first place!) The on-vehicle antenna situation is currently limited to a dual band mini-magmount whip. I also have a CB antenna on a magmount which can be pressed into service. Using an LDG YT-100 this will tune up on at least 10m and 20m (other bands untested). Antennas that I use for car-portable work (mainly UKAC at the moment) include an 8-element 2m Yagi, a 23-element 70cm DK7ZB Yagi and a 7-element 70cm DK7ZB Yagi. I have a 9m sectional mast with a Yaesu G-450C rotator attached which seems to live in the boot. The rotator controller is powered from a 1000W inverter under the passenger seat. I used to use a dedicated laptop for logging in the car (a super-portable IBM Thinkpad X31), however this proved to have unreliable USB ports (at least when it came to rig-control) and also it's a 32-bit laptop which is becoming increasingly difficult to support. I now use my normal day-to-day Sony Vaio laptop with a second dedicated OS installed just for radio work (build instructions here ). I use my mobile phone as a personal hotspot to get access to clusters, ON4KST etc. Future plans for the mobile setup include more permanent mounting of the front panel (it currently just sits in front of the gear sticks) and a better HF antenna setup. I may permanently install a Raspberry Pi-based DMR hotspot in the car, which could also connect to the FT-857d and be used either for networked rig control, or accessed over the network and used natively as a logging PC for UKACs. I'd also like to install a seconds battery to run the radio kit so that I don't kill the starter battery, but that's a bit more involved. Portable I also have a couple of DMR Handheld radios - sometimes these are in the car with me - and a couple of Baofeng UV-5Rs programmed for FM satellite use. I have completed a grand total of one satellite contact.","tags":"pages","url":"https://m5mat.github.io/pages/shack.html","loc":"https://m5mat.github.io/pages/shack.html"},{"title":"70cm UKAC March 2020","text":"Problems: The antenna was swinging on the mast, so anything up to about 30Â° out. About 10 minutes after the start, the voltage at the rig started dropping to about 10V after a couple of seconds of transmit. This causes the rig to either FM or to just cut out completely. The voltmeter on by ignition-sense disconnect box wasn't showing a problem. I didn't manage to properly diagnose the problem but feeding the system from the cigar lighter socket seemed to fix the problem. In messing about with the power, I lost audio to the right side of my headphones. This is annoying but not a deal-breaker so I pressed on. I'm not convinced that the radiation pattern of the antenna is particularly good. This is hard to judge given that I wasn't sure where the antenna was actually pointing, but I did seem to work more people who were about 30Â° off the centre of the beam (taking into account the fact that it wasn't point where it should have been), or about 120Â° off.","tags":"Contests","url":"https://m5mat.github.io/70cm-ukac-march-2020.html","loc":"https://m5mat.github.io/70cm-ukac-march-2020.html"},{"title":"70cm FMAC March 2020","text":"Got set up with enough time to have a bit of a play in the FM section, using 10W to the 23-ele DK7ZB. 11 QSOs with ODX being GW8ASD.","tags":"Contests","url":"https://m5mat.github.io/70cm-fmac-march-2020.html","loc":"https://m5mat.github.io/70cm-fmac-march-2020.html"},{"title":"2m UKAC March 2020","text":"","tags":"Contests","url":"https://m5mat.github.io/2m-ukac-march-2020.html","loc":"https://m5mat.github.io/2m-ukac-march-2020.html"},{"title":"70cm UKAC February 2020","text":"Yet again, an uninspiring evening.

When it receives a beacon from another badge it will flash its LEDs. Scouts: Badges will be in two groups ('Team A' and 'Team B'). The badge will periodically beacon its team and while it's not beaconing it will listen. If it receives a beacon from another member of the same team then it will flass it's green LED, if it receives a beacon from the other team then it will flash its red LED. Explorers: Pressing the button will trigger a query transmission. This transmission includes the badges own team. Any badges in range which see this query transmission will respond with their own team. If the badges are from the same team then they'll flash their green LEDs, if they are from different teams then they'll flash their red LEDs. Expansion Activities Is it possible to control a TV using this hardware? Could turn it into a TV-B-Gone type device. Can we create some sort of game, maybe something like laser-tag? Game idea 1: Laser Tag - Badges are on two teams. If your badge 'sees' a member of the other team then you lose a life. After you lose three lives (or some other configurable number) then you're out of the game. Game idea 2: Zombies - All badges are 'people' (green LED lit), one badge becomes a 'zombie' (red LED lit). If a person 'sees' a zombie then they become a zombie too. Last person alive wins. Could add a piezo buzzer for audio? (would tie in nicely with the game idea).

A bit of a warning to those who intend to upgrade or otherwise change callsign, and care about your UKAC results... You need to do it at the end of a year. I upgraded to a full license a the RSGB Convention last year. Due to errors at Ofcom I've been issued a few different callsigns over the last few months (full details here , in case you're interested). I entered the January 2m UKAC using my then-valid callsign M0IZZ. That's no longer my callsign - it's now M5MAT - but what I didn't anticipate is that UKAC results are tied to a callsign, not to an individual so even though M0IZZ was me, I can't have credit for my Jan 2m entry in the overall 2m and overall UKAC results. Interestingly if M0IZZ is re-issued within the year, which it can be - my G2KS callsign has been re-issued, whoever gets it will inherit my Jan 2m credit. I accept that how this situation arose in my case is slightly odd, however it's entirely possible that someone upgrading from Foundation to Intermediate or Intermediate to Full (or indeed going through the whole set over the course of a year) could be disadvantaged if they choose to surrender their old licence, as we're encouraged to do.

Yay me. After the result was confirmed I filled in a paper application so that I could request a specific callsign - M5MAT (the online system doesn't allow you to request a particular callsign). As far as I could tell that callsign was available - it wasn't registered on QRZ.com, it didn't come up as being assigned in recent Ofcom FoIA responses and nothing showed up when searching for it on Google, Twitter etc. After paying the Â£20 fee Ofcom were happy to confirm that I had been issued the callsign G2KS. Err, wot?!? That's obviously not the callsign I requested, but it's also not from the M0 range which they should have issued if the callsign that I had requested was not available. This didn't make any sense, so I phoned them up. I've always found the people on the phones at Ofcom to be really helpful and this time was no different. I explained what had happened and that I was confused about the callsign I had been issued. They dug out the paperwork and confirmed that I had requested G2KS and had therefore been issued it. I told them that this simply wasn't the case and I suspected that paperwork may have been inadvertently shuffled so could they please compare handwriting or something. Apparently whoever had applied for G2KS had sufficiently different handwriting to me to make it obvious that the paperwork had been mixed up somehow. They informed me that they'd need to go via their policy people to get it resolved. Lo and behold, a couple of days later G2KS was revoked and I was issued with M0IZZ. This was still not what I had requested but obviously M5MAT was not available for some reason so they had issued me with the next available M0 callsign. I was annoyed that I didn't get my choice but there you go. All sorted. Or was it? Looks like in a recent FoI @ofcom provided a list of valid ham radio callsigns as of Sept 2019 minus personal info https://t.co/X5rqVW7af4 â Peter Goodhall (2M0SQL) (@2m0sql) January 4, 2020 A tweet from 2M0SQL alerted me to a more recent FoIA response from Ofcom which was published in September 2019. M5MAT didn't show as assigned in this list. The chance of that callsign being issued in the period between the list being published and me requesting it was pretty small, so I phoned up Ofcom and re-explained the situation. They confirmed that M5MAT was still available and that they would have to speak to their policy people - I guess their policy department must be one of the busier departments there. A couple of days later I received a slightly concerning email. My full license had been revoked. No other explanation, nothing about another one being issued or anything like that. By the time I had the email and phoned them up their helpdesk was closed too. I logged in to the licensing portal and my old intermediate license was there but nothing about a full one. It dawned on me that when I was originally issued with my G2KS callsign I had to pay an invoice via the licensing portal. I didn't get an email or any other notification to tell me that I needed to pay, the invoice just silently appeared and sat there. I eventually found my way back to that part of the portal (it's not very obvious) and there was another invoice for me to pay. I had hoped that I wouldn't need to pay anything extra - I'd already payed the Â£20 fee once - but at least its not too much. Once I paid it I was issued M5MAT and there we go, 4 callsigns (including my intermediate one) in 4 months and the reason why I've popped up during UKAC contests in multiple different guises recently.","tags":"Blog","url":"https://m5mat.github.io/m5mat.html","loc":"https://m5mat.github.io/m5mat.html"},{"title":"2m UKAC January 2020","text":"This was the first (update: and also the last) use of my new Full callsign M0IZZ.

I7CSB (2019-07-02) - A 2m SSB contact using just 10W to an 8-element yagi over 1736km. Nothing un-remarkable about that! Sporadic E might have had a part in this. 9M4SJJJ (2019-10-19) - The first contact of JOTA 2019 from GB1WSG was with 9M4SJJJ in Malasia. We used DMR for this and some of our youngsters got to talk to youngsters there. G0ABI (2019-06-09) - When I was a newly-licensed novice, the idea of satellites interested me, but they seemed difficult to get my head round, I also wasn't too sure whether or not novices were allowed to use satellites at the time. Well Intermediates definitly can, and I did. Pete will probably be the one and only person to contact 2E1HNK via satellite as I'll be using MÃIZZ now. This QSO was FM via SO-50. Summary Most of my operating this year was in the RSGB UKAC series of contests - much like last year. Other notable events included running JOTA for 1st Woodmancote Scouts, which saw approximately 70 youngsters get their first&ast introduction to Amateur Radio. The village also now has 70 more morse keys and buzzers in circulation than it did before, so apologies to the parents... Last, and not least, I passed my full license exam and became MÃIZZ ( edit: and then M5MAT ).

This was the first appearance of my newly-finished 23-element yagi. Unfortunately conditions were not good so there wasn't much demonstrable improvement over the old 7-element one. An additional problem was that whilst it is quite easy to get the 7-element up to the full 6m mast height (and I think 9m might be quite straightforward too, if I don't put the rotator too far up), I had to limit the mast to 4.5m as the weight is just too much to raise safely on my own. This height puts the boom at about 3.5-4m agl, as the boom is long enough to need stays, meaning that there needs to be sufficient height above the boom for the stays to attach to the mast. This reduced height probably had an impact on performance too.","tags":"Contests","url":"https://m5mat.github.io/70cm-ukac-november-2019.html","loc":"https://m5mat.github.io/70cm-ukac-november-2019.html"},{"title":"Rules for a Good Callsign","text":"Having passed my full license exam, and now that you can essentially pick whichever (unissued) callsign you want, my mind has turned to trying to work out how to define a 'good' callsign. What I settled on is... Callsign should not contain character combinations that are used for other purposes, e.g. 'CQ' Callsign should not end in 'K', as that could be confusing in Morse. For Morse, shorter (i.e. fewer dots and dashes) is better, and dorts are shorter than dashes. Callsign prefix should have originally been issed during a plausible time period. G3xxx was originally issued between 1946 and 1971 - it might be odd for someone who was born in the 1980's to be issued one of these. Other considerations include: Is the callsign should be available to register on social media/other online services such as Twitter? Is the callsign available as a personalised number plate? Would having a newer-style 'short call' cause more problems than it's worth? More likely that people ask for repeats, believing that they have not copied the whole callsign, or refusing to work me believing me to be a pirate. Also some of the 'old timers' might be of the opinion that short calls shouldn't have been issued and refuse to work it. Given all this, my shortlist at the moment is: M5MC (-- ..... -- -.-.)

M5MAT (-- ..... -- .- -)","tags":"Blog","url":"https://m5mat.github.io/rules-for-a-good-callsign.html","loc":"https://m5mat.github.io/rules-for-a-good-callsign.html"},{"title":"Full License","text":"I sat my full license exam at the 2019 RSGB convention, and passed!

This is a list of the standards which I adhere to. It is primarily for my own reference although if anyone else decides to adopt these standards then that's great. In most cases I've tried to use publically-available already-published standards. Power Wherever possible equipment should run off 13.8VDC. Connections will be via 30A powerpole connectors wired to the ARES/RACES standard Where connection to domestic 230VAC mains power is required then the UK mains connectors will be used. Antenna connectors For frequencies above 100MHz, N-Type connectors will be used. For frequencies below 100MHz, SO239/PL259 connectors will be used. In some cases BNC connections are used. This should be restricted to specific deployment scenarios (typically portable) and in all cases an appropriate adapted should be on hand to convert to the standard connector.

I can't offer any support on the product itself, other than by providing the information present here. With this module, a Raspberry Pi can be extended by a display and buttons. For many applications, a typical PC monitor and keyboard is too large and unwieldy. This gap closes the Raspi LCD. Projects such as web radios, streaming clients, home automation systems, ... can use this hardware. The circuit and a source code in C are available as open source. The basic \"driver functionality\" and necessary hardware access functions are implemented in this sample application. The keyboard area can be equipped with various buttons or separated.

In the current version this is emulated in the software (-> no driver necessary). The display with its 128 x 64 pixels is in principle a 1kByte large memory, with which each bit corresponds to a pixel. In the software, the coordinates (x / y) correspond to the top left corner (0/0) and bottom right (127/63). Since the smallest organizational unit is one byte, 8 pixels are always transmitted and stored together. The least significant bit of the first byte is the origin in the upper left corner. Then follow for all 1024 bytes, the bits: D1 = (0/1), ... D7 = (0/7), etc. Since the memory of the display only describe, but not read, there is a small problem with the pixel-wise Presentation. Should a function change a single pixel, The other 7 bits of the associated byte must also be transferred. For this reason, a so-called frame buffer is implemented in the software. This is a 1: 1 memory image of the display. All operations are done with the framebuffer. With the function LCD_WriteFramebuffer(); then the output and display is done on the display. Output of the text \"Hello World\": LCD_SetFont(0); LCD_PrintXY(0,0, \"Hello World\"); Drawing a rectangle with transparent fill and two pixel line width: LCD_SetFillColor(-1); LCD_DrawRect(10,10,100,40,1); Bitmaps can be converted to C arrays using the BMP2C V1.0 program . eg: const uint8 bmp_raspi [458] = {57, 64, 0Ã00, ... 0Ã00}; Output of bitmap at position(0/0): LCD_DrawBitmap(0,0, bmp_raspi); Buttons The individual keys switch to ground when the key is pressed. Since the corresponding GPIO PINs are configured as an input with pullup, a depressed key means logical 0, an unpressed key logical 1. The function UpdateButtons(); ensures that the state of the buttons is stored in the two variables ButtonPressed and Button as one bit each. Macros such as: BUTTON_PRESSED_UP , BUTTON_PRESSED_RIGHT , ... allow comfortable use of the keyboard. Backlight On the Raspi LCD there is a switching transistor for controlling the LED background illumination. The corresponding GPIO pin can be set via the function SetBacklight(); be controlled.","tags":"Blog","url":"https://m5mat.github.io/emsystech-raspilcd.html","loc":"https://m5mat.github.io/emsystech-raspilcd.html"},{"title":"Suppliers","text":"Antenna Parts Aluminium Aluminium Warehouse Aluminium stock up to 5m (metric and imperial sizes) Aluminium sheets up to 3mm, cut to size Collection possible Good prices 1st Choice Metals Local (but collection probably not possible) All imperial sizes Aluminium stock up to 3m Wickes Easy collection 1m lengths, some 2m lengths Expensive compared to others Tends to be softer grades B&Q Easy collection 1m lengths, some 2m lengths Very expensive compared to others Tends to be softer grades Only stockist of 20mm box section that I can find!

I was down on Burson Moor in Cornwall (IO70sw) and taking down the station whilst in a 'afflicted' state was no fun at all. The less said about that the better. 70cm was much better, although RF conditions were challenging and the WX was not great either - no rain but high winds and bitterly cold. Having been in touch with Mark M0RKX during the week, I used his regular site in IO92ba as he's not able to get out for the 2m and 70cm event for the time being. I was interested in how this site compared to my regular site at Sudeley Hill in IO91aw. Access at Mark's site is better - the ground is firmer and there is a very stout gatepost to lash a mast too, additionally he has explicit permission from the farmer to be there. RF-wise - my initial impression was that Sudeley Hill was actually better, although I'm fairly certain that prevailing RF conditions played more of a part that the site itself.

Whilst there's nothing wrong with this approach it does rely on either knowing the local area well, or having contact with someone who does. This isn't always available, for example holiday operation, moving to a new area or simply that all the good peaks have been taken. There must be a better way... My approach to finding new hilltops to activate involves finding candidate hilltops, assessing whether operation is possible from that location, and then working out whether it's worth the effort of attempting to activate it. These are some of the resources I use to do this. Find Candidate Sites Overpass Turbo Overpass Turbo allows users to run scripts against the Overpass API, part of the OpenStreetMap project. The script below finds ways, nodes and relationships (i.e. any object) with an elevation greater than 300m a.s.l (which works well for the area I'm interested in, depending on your local area you might need to change this). It then searches the area around those objects up to a radius to 100m (you can tune this too, if you need to) to see if there are any highways, but excluding footpaths, bridleways, tracks, service roads, unclassified roads etc. This theoretically returns a list/map of summits which are accessible by car.

In some ways this is more reliable that the OverPass API approach as the Google Maps elevation data comes from surveys rather than user-entered data, however there are limitations in how many times the Google Maps API can be queried, so the application is not as accurate as it could be. Assess Accessability Is the land privately owned? Is it possible to get a vehicle to the site? Are there time restrictions (for example a car park that closes at dusk)? Is there sufficient space to set up antennas? The answers to many of these questions can be found using online mapping services including Bing Maps which has Ordnance Survey maps available and Google Maps which has aerial photography and also Google's fantastic Street View service. Assess Radio Coverage Of cource there's no point investing time and energy into climbing a peak is it's not going to give you the coverage you need. Radio Mobile Online (and also the offline version) and Splat! are fantastic tools for assessing a site's radio coverage. Their use cannot be described briefly here but there are plenty of tutorials available. One I particularly like for Radio Mobile's offline versions can be found here","tags":"Blog","url":"https://m5mat.github.io/finding-good-hill-top-portable-sites.html","loc":"https://m5mat.github.io/finding-good-hill-top-portable-sites.html"},{"title":"Yaesu FT-857d Power Output Stuck","text":"I fired up my Yaesu FT857d to take part in the RSGB's April 2018 2m UKAC Contest a couple of days ago to discover that the RF power output (Menu Option 75) was stuck at 50W and wouldn't change by rotating the VFO knob as it should. Thankfully, despite being /P, I was in an area with good mobile coverage I had a quick google and although I found a few others who had experienced a few similar issues , there was only one viable suggestion for resolving the problem, which was to perform a reset. There are three variations of reset available on an FT857d detailed here . It was the FUNC + PWR one that worked for me, however it wasn't clear to me that this is a power-on reset, so the rig has to be off for it to work.

It was surprisingly comfortable with the lay-by being set back from the road and separated from it by some trees. This reduced the sound of passing vehicles (not that there were many) and reduced the chance of muggles taking an interest. This was the first outing for both my Yaesu FT857d and Diamond X200. There was a small issue with the FT857d ( see TechNote#1 ) but that was resolved on-site. The setup performed well, but has left me wanting a 2m Yagi! The next problem that I encountered was when I tried to submit the log the following day - I submitted it fine but got an email enquiring about my RSGB membership status - I hadn't realised that membership was a prerequisite for entering.
